    <section id="week1">
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>This week I tried to set up my GitHub repository. Setting up GitHub Pages was familiar since I had done it
            many times before. The main issue came from me
            forgetting the steps to do it. I have a love-hate relationship with Github. Once everything was installed,
            working on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript felt familiar.</p>

        <h3>To do</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Submit my repo URL through moodle</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="week2">
        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>This week we learned how to use different APIs, including one for weather and one for air quality. Got a
            little bit confused but it seems that half the class were also a bit behind as well. Ended up understadning
            and completing it in the end so I'm happy.</p>

    <section id="week3">
        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>This week, we worked on learning about Flask as well as building a web page. What is Flask? It is a Python
            framework built to make websites dynamic. It was easy to follow. Surprisingly, creating routes, and the
            templates felt satisfying and fun. And to see it all come together make it worth while.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>work on the project I</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="week4">
        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>This week, John and I built our first project for this class. Using air quality gtom the World Air Quality
            Index API. It was a simple but working website. I liked how much information can be displayed in the
            ternimal.</p>

    <section id="week5">
        <h2>Week 5 </h2>
        <p>Today in class, we continued working with Flask. At the end of the class we had our 2nd exercise and I worked
            on it with John.</p>
        <h3>To Do</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Look into Project II</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="week6">
        <h2>Week 6</h2>
        <p>This week we are still doing Flask, this time going into the depths of hell. Just kidding. We dove deeper
            into the advanced features (POST requests). Also learned about uploading images to the server.</p>
        <h3>To Do</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start working on Project II</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="week7">
        <h2>Week 7</h2>
        <p>This week we learned more about FLASK. I was a bit behind during the lectures but got throught it using the
            moodle websites. At the end we had an exercise and I made a website about making your custom donuts and
            putting your name to then submit.</p>

    <section id="week8">
        <h2>Week 8</h2>
        <p>Today, we were introduced to MongoDB and learned how to connect Flask with MongoDB. It was probably the most
            confusing class because i was a bit lost at first. A few clarification from the teacher and I was succesful
            again. We made an account, made a cluster, collection, and then connect it to out Flask app. It was fun to
            see the data pop up in MongoDB.</p>

        <section id="week9">
            <p>I was sick today so I wasn't able to come to class. I took the time to start brainstorming for the final
                project. I didn't have the chance to do exercise 4 and try out other classmates projects. </p>

        <section id="week10">
            <h2>Week 10</h2>
            <p>This week I focused entirely on Exercise 5, which was the most difficult task so far. Making unique
                visualizations for each query was a bit frustrating. At the end I used ChatGPT to help with the
                debugging</p>
