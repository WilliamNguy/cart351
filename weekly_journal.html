    <!-- WEEK 1 -->
    <section id="week1">
        <h2>Week 1 — Setting Up GitHub & Python</h2>
        <p>This week I set up my GitHub repository, installed Python, and created both the main page and this journal
            page. It feels nice to have a dedicated space to document my learning journey in CART 351.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>Setting up GitHub Pages was familiar since I had done it before. The main issue came from using a new
            laptop—none of my old installations were there anymore. I had to reinstall Node.js, VS Code extensions,
            Python packages, and set up my SSH key to clone the repository.</p>
        <p>Once everything was installed again, working on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript felt smooth.</p>

        <blockquote>"The best way to learn is to reflect on what you're doing while you're doing it." — My thought while
            setting this up</blockquote>

        <h3>Goals for This Week</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete the GitHub setup and submit my repo URL</li>
            <li>Get comfortable with updating this journal weekly</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- WEEK 2 -->
    <section id="week2">
        <h2>Week 2 — Working With Weather & Air Quality APIs</h2>
        <p>This week we worked with APIs, specifically the Weather API and the World Air Quality Index API.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>The initial concept was straightforward—APIs let you pull data from external sources. But the in-class
            exercise quickly became confusing because the instructions were very compact. I accidentally skipped steps
            and had to backtrack.</p>
        <p>Working with my teammate helped a lot. We caught each other's mistakes and eventually completed the exercise
            together.</p>
        <p>I’m interested in using real-time data creatively instead of just showing numbers on a screen.</p>

        <h3>Goals for This Week</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Work on Project 1</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- WEEK 3 -->
    <section id="week3">
        <h2>Week 3 — Intro to Flask & Jinja Templates</h2>
        <p>This week, we started learning about Flask and built a simple web app. Flask felt surprisingly
            straightforward and enjoyable to follow.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>The steps were clear—setting up the environment, creating routes, and rendering templates. I enjoyed seeing
            Python connect directly to HTML through Jinja.</p>
        <p>I also read “The Space Between Us,” which explored a poetic use of location tracking. It inspired me to think
            about how tools like Flask can create meaningful, emotionally driven interactions.</p>

        <h3>Goals for This Week</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Experiment more with Flask templates</li>
            <li>Work on Project 1 with Cathy</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- WEEK 4 -->
    <section id="week4">
        <h2>Week 4 — Building Project 1: AirQuest</h2>
        <p>This week I focused on completing Project 1 with Cathy. We created <strong>AirQuest</strong>, a
            terminal-based game that uses real-time air quality data.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>Working in the terminal forced us to be creative with visuals—colors, ASCII art, and poetic warnings like
            “You inhale capitalism.” It made environmental data feel more emotional than just statistics.</p>
        <p>I also read “Dear Loneliness,” which discussed emotional data collection. It made me reflect on how our game
            uses environmental data as an abstraction rather than lived experience.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- WEEK 5 -->
    <section id="week5">
        <h2>Week 5 — Flask II & Personal Website Updates</h2>
        <p>This week we continued working with Flask, focusing on how templates and routes communicate.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>I’m getting more comfortable with Flask’s structure. Comparing code with Cathy helped me catch typos and
            understand the logic more clearly.</p>
        <p>I also updated my personal website, leaning into a retro, pixel-inspired aesthetic.</p>

        <h3>Goals for This Week</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start planning Project 2</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- WEEK 6 -->
    <section id="week6">
        <h2>Week 6 — Sessions, POST Requests & Split Decision</h2>
        <p>This week we learned how to use Flask sessions, POST requests, and JavaScript Fetch to handle asynchronous
            communication.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>I finally understood client–server communication more clearly. Working with sessions showed me new ways to
            store temporary data.</p>
        <p>Cathy and I began designing our new project: <strong>Split Decision</strong>, an interactive group
            decision-making app.</p>

        <h3>Goals for Next Week</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start building the structure of our Flask app</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- WEEK 7 -->
    <section id="week7">
        <h2>Week 7 — Remote Learning: File I/O & Donut Review App</h2>
        <p>Because of the STM strike, I completed the Flask IV tutorial remotely. I learned how to read and write text
            and JSON files in Python and practiced sending data with Fetch.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>The donut review page was fun to build—users pick a donut, write a comment, and see it instantly added to the
            “Community Donut Wall.”</p>
        <p>Debugging on my own was harder, but I learned a lot from problem-solving without immediate help.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- WEEK 8 -->
    <section id="week8">
        <h2>Week 8 — Flask + MongoDB</h2>
        <p>This week we connected Flask to MongoDB using a cloud database and environment variables.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>Since I already had some foundational experience with databases, things felt smoother. I’m considering
            switching Split Decision from JSON files to MongoDB in the future.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- WEEK 9 -->
    <section id="week9">
        <h2>Week 9 — Real-Time Apps with Flask-SocketIO</h2>
        <p>This week we learned how to create real-time interactions using WebSockets and SocketIO.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>I found this extremely engaging—real-time shared interactions made the app feel dynamic and multiplayer-like.
        </p>
        <p>Outside class, I fixed some broken GitHub Pages links due to case-sensitivity.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- WEEK 10 -->
    <section id="week10">
        <h2>Week 10 — Exercise 5: Data Visualizations</h2>
        <p>This week I focused entirely on Exercise 5, which was the most challenging task so far.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>Designing unique visualizations for each query pushed me to combine technical logic with creative layout and
            animation. I ran into issues like data overlap, spacing problems, and animation drift. Collaborating with
            Cathy helped a lot with debugging and idea-sharing.</p>
        <p>Despite being long and complex, the final results were rewarding and made me more confident in dynamic,
            data-driven design.</p>
